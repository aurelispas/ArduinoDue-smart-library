# ArduinoDue-smart-library
ArduinoDue solution to work with relays, PWMs, IRemote and other staff for home automation 
Ð¡ontrol of all parts will be provided through Serial port(or bluetooth / im already thinking about it/ or both) so you 
the main core wiil be ChibiOS.
the point is that there will be a library wrappers for other libraries
that you will be able to connect their own, if they do not fit to your shields.
list of Classes what im going to do:

Relay
Pwm
IRemote 
RGB leb (shields)
Temperature sensors (1-wire/analog)
humidity (1-wire/analog)
carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases
posibly CO2 sensor (if i wiil have costs for it)
atmosferic/water pressure
some flow meters will be able too(maybe)
